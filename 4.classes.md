# History of class in javascript
JavaScript does not have a concept of class like other programming languages such as Java and C#. In ES5, you can use a constructor function and prototype inheritance to create a “class”.

function Person(firstName, lastName){
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
}

const p1 = new Person('karn', 'kumar');
console.log(p1.getFullName());

# ES6 allows you to define a class, which is simply syntactic sugar for creating constructor functions and prototypal inheritance:

class Person{
    constructor(firstName, lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    getFullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
}

const p2 = new Person('Aman', 'Singh');
console.log(p2.getFullName());

# TypeScript class adds type annotations to the properties and methods of the class
class Person{
    private firstName;
    private lastName;
    constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string){
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    getFullName(): string {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
}

const p2 = new Person('Sohan', 'khan');
console.log(p2.getFullName());

# Access modifiers (private , public, protected)
-> The private modifier limits the visibility to the same class only. When you add the private modifier to a property or method, you can access that property or method within the same class.

-> The public modifier allows class properties and methods to be accessible from all locations. If you don’t specify any access modifier for properties and methods, they will take the public modifier by default.

-> The protected modifier allows properties and methods of a class to be accessible within the same class and subclasses.
class Person {
    protected ssn: string;
    
    // other code
}

# Readonly modifier
TypeScript provides the readonly modifier that allows you to mark the properties of a class immutable. The assignment to a readonly property can only occur in one of two places:

In the property declaration.
In the constructor of the same class.

class Person {
    readonly birthDate: Date;

    constructor(birthDate: Date) {
        this.birthDate = birthDate;
    }
}
let person = new Person(new Date(1990, 12, 25));
person.birthDate = new Date(1991, 12, 25); // Compile error

# getters & setters
The getter/setters are also known as accessors/mutators.

class Person{
    constructor(private _name: string){
        this._name = _name;
    }

    public set firstName(name: string) {
        if(name === 'admin') throw new Error('you cannnot set admin name')
        this._name = name;
    }

    public get firstName() {
        return this._name;
    }
}
const p1 = new Person('Lakshman')
console.log(p1.firstName);

p1.firstName = 'admin1';
console.log(p1.firstName);

// output
Lakshman
admin1

# Inheritance
A class can reuse the properties and methods of another class. This is called inheritance in TypeScript.
The class which inherits properties and methods is called the child class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the parent class.

JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, not classical inheritance like Java or C#. ES6 introduces the class syntax that is simply the syntactic sugar of the prototypal inheritance. TypeScript supports inheritance like ES6.

class Person {
    private fName: string;
    private lName: string;
    constructor(fName: string, lName: string) {
        this.fName = fName;
        this.lName = lName;
    }
    public getFullName() {
        return `${this.fName} ${this.lName}`
    }
    public describe() {
        return `This is ${this.fName} ${this.lName}`;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person{
    constructor(private _fName: string, private _lName: string, private jobTitle: string){
        super(_fName, _lName);
    }
}
const e1 = new Employee('Rames', 'kumar', 'Enginner');
console.log(e1.getFullName());
console.log(e1.describe());

# Method overriding
If you want the Employee class has its own version of the describe() method, you can define it in the Employee class

class Person {
    private fName: string;
    private lName: string;
    constructor(fName: string, lName: string) {
        this.fName = fName;
        this.lName = lName;
    }
    public getFullName() {
        return `${this.fName} ${this.lName}`
    }
    public describe() {
        return `This is ${this.fName} ${this.lName}`;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person{
    constructor(private _fName: string, private _lName: string, private jobTitle: string){
        super(_fName, _lName);
    }
    describe() {
        return super.describe() + `.I am an ${this.jobTitle}`;
    }
}
const e1 = new Employee('Ramesh', 'kumar', 'Enginner');
console.log(e1.getFullName());
console.log(e1.describe());

# Static methods
Unlike an instance property, a static property is shared among all instances of a class.
To declare a static property, you use the static keyword. To access a static property, you use the className.propertyName syntax

class Duty {
    private _name: string;
    static headCount: number = 0;
    constructor(name: string){
        this._name = name;
        Duty.headCount++;
    }
}
const d1 = new Duty('Amar');
const d2 = new Duty('Akbar');
const d3 = new Duty('Anthony');
console.log(Duty.headCount); //3

Similar to the static property, a static method is also shared across instances of the class. To declare a static method, you use the static keyword before the method name. 

class Duty {
    private _name: string;
    private static headCount: number = 0;
    constructor(name: string){
        this._name = name;
        Duty.headCount++;
    }

    public static getHeadCount() {
        return Duty.headCount;
    }
}
const d1 = new Duty('Amar');
const d2 = new Duty('Akbar');
console.log(Duty.getHeadCount()); //2

# TypeScript Abstract Classes

An abstract class is typically used to define common behaviors for derived classes to extend. Unlike a regular class, an abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.

Typically, an abstract class contains one or more abstract methods.

An abstract method does not contain implementation. It only defines the signature of the method without including the method body. An abstract method must be implemented in the derived class.

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
An Abstract class has at least one abstract method.
To use an abstract class, you need to inherit it and provide the implementation for the abstract methods.

abstract class Employee {
    constructor(private _fName: string, private _lName: string) {
    }
    public abstract getSalary(hours: number): number;
}

class Labour extends Employee{
    constructor(_fName: string, _lName: string, private hours: number){
        super(_fName, _lName)
    }

    public getSalary(): number {
        return 500 * this.hours;
    }
}

const l1 = new Labour('Bundi', 'Shaw', 10);
console.log(l1.getSalary());
