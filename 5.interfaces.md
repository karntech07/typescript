# TypeScript interfaces define the contracts within your code
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
function getFullName(person: Person) {
    return `${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`;
}

let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe'
};

console.log(getFullName(john));

# Optional properties
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    middleName?: string;
    lastName: string;
}

# Readonly properties
If properties should be modifiable only when the object is first created, you can use the readonly keyword before the name of the property

interface Person {
  readonly ssn: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

let person: Person;
person = {
  ssn: '171-28-0926',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

person.ssn = '171-28-0000'; // error TS2540: Cannot assign to 'ssn' because it is a read-only property.

# Extending interface
Suppose that you have an interface called Mailable that contains two methods called send() and queue() as follows:
interface Mailable {
    send(email: string): boolean
    queue(email: string): boolean
}

And you have many classes that already implemented the Mailable interface.
Now, you want to add a new method to the Mailable interface that sends an email later like this:
later(email: string, after: number): boolean

However, adding the later() method to the Mailable interface would break the current code.

To avoid this, you can create a new interface that extends the Mailable interface:

interface FutureMailable extends Mailable {
    later(email: string, after: number): boolean
}


class Mail implements FutureMailable {
    later(email: string, after: number): boolean {
        console.log(`Send email to ${email} in ${after} ms.`);
        return true;
    }
    send(email: string): boolean {
        console.log(`Sent email to ${email} after ${after} ms. `);
        return true;
    }
    queue(email: string): boolean {
        console.log(`Queue an email to ${email}.`);
        return true;
    }
}

# Interfaces extending multiple interfaces
interface C {
    c(): void
}

interface D extends B, C {
    d(): void
}
In this example, the interface D extends the interfaces B and C. So D has all the methods of B and C interfaces, which are a(), b(), and c() methods.

# Interfaces vs Abstract Classes
Aspect	                 Interfaces	                          Abstract Classes
Purpose	                 Define contractual structure.	      Provide common functionality and structure.
Implementation	         Contains only method signatures.	  Can contain implemented methods and abstract methods.
Multiple Inheritance	Supports multiple interface implementation.	   Supports single class
Implementation Flexibility No implementation code in interfaces.  Mixes implemented and abstract methods.
Instantiation           Interfaces can’t be instantiated.   Abstract classes can’t be instantiated directly.
Usage                  Designing contracts and structure.     Sharing functionality among related classes.
